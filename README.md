# HAR

The folder [data](https://github.com/davidgn21/HAR/tree/main/data) contains the Human Activity Recognition Trondheim Dataset (HARTH). It consists of acceleration data of 22 subjects, which wore two three-axial Axivity AX3 (Axivity Ltd., Newcastle, UK) accelerometers on the thigh and lower back.

## Machine Learning Experiments
The folder [experiments](https://github.com/ntnu-ai-lab/harth-ml-experiments/tree/main/experiments) contains all our experiments. It is possible to train a K-Nearest Neighbors, a Support Vector Machine, a Random Forest, a Convolutional Neural Network.
